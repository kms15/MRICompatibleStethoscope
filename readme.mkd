# MRI compatible stethoscope

This will a bit of documentation on a MRI compatible stethoscope I've built.
It requires some machining to build, and thus I suspect it will be more useful
as an example for other hobbyists learning machining than for people who are
looking for an easy way to get an MRI compatible stethoscope.
